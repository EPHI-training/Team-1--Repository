# Project Description 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 1. About Dataset
### Context
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

### Content
The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.

### Acknowledgements

We thank NDMC/EPHI for creating this training opportunity and the efforts made by colleagues Biniyam and Maelaf for giving the training and sharing their knowledge, skill, and experience.
### Inspiration

Can you build a machine learning model to accurately predict whether or not the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not?
